Project Title: Analyzing Demographic Characteristics of Marginal Workers in Tamil Nadu\par
\par
Project Description: This project aims to analyze the demographic characteristics of marginal workers in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. Marginal workers are individuals who engage in irregular or low-income employment, and this analysis will focus on understanding their age, industrial category, and sex. The primary objective is to perform a socioeconomic analysis and create visualizations that effectively represent the distribution of marginal workers across different categories. To achieve this, we will define clear objectives, plan the analysis approach, select appropriate visualization types, and use Python and data visualization libraries for analysis.\par

\par
2.Data Cleaning: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Ensure data is formatted correctly for analysis.\par
\par
3.Data Exploration: Explore the dataset to understand its structure and contents. Perform summary statistics to gain initial insights.\par
\par
4.Demographic Analysis: Execute the demographic analysis approach as described above to understand age and gender distributions.\par
\par
5.Industrial Category Analysis: Identify and analyze industrial categories within the dataset, then create visualizations to represent the distribution.\par
\par
6.Socioeconomic Insights: Perform in-depth analysis to derive socioeconomic insights, considering relationships between age, gender, and industrial categories.\par
\par
7.Visualization Selection: Select appropriate visualization types based on the analysis objectives and data characteristics. Ensure that the chosen visualizations effectively communicate the insights.\par
